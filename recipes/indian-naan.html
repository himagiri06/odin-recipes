    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is an authentic Indian naan recipe that's broiled instead of
      pan-fried. I have made it many times. It goes well with Indian curry
      dishes that have a lot of gravy, such as butter chicken.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>

      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>

      <li>¼ cup ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover
        and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture,
        yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee. Mix into a soft dough, then knead on a
        floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
        Place dough into a large greased bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm
        place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down dough, then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into six equal
        pieces. Roll each piece out into 8-inch rounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush dough rounds
        with remaining ghee and sprinkle with kalonji. Cook one at a time under
        the broiler until puffed and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.
